## I/O Performance


```{sh, eval = F}
sudo hdparm -Tt /dev/nvme0n1p2
```

Timing cached reads:   44096 MB in  2.00 seconds = 22095.91 MB/sec  
Timing buffered disk reads: 4470 MB in  3.00 seconds = 1489.83 MB/sec  

All files were stored on the following drive.  

```{sh, eval = F}
sudo hdparm -Tt /dev/sda1
```

Timing cached reads:   45870 MB in  2.00 seconds = 22986.94 MB/sec  
Timing buffered disk reads: 514 MB in  3.01 seconds = 170.57 MB/sec
